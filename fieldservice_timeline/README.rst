Configuration
=============

The Field Service Web Timeline View module can be used with minimal initial configuration.

Order Stages
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The stage of an order is used to monitor its progress. Stages can be configured
based on your company's specific business needs. A basic set of order stages
comes pre-configured for use.

#. Go to *Field Service > Configuration > Stages*
#. Create or edit a stage
#. Set the name for the stage.
#. Set the sequence order for the stage.
#. Select *Order* type to apply this stage to your orders.
#. Additonally, you can set a color for the stage.

You need to add attribute mention below with the tag <timeline> as base element.

* colors (optional): it allows to set certain specific colors if the expressed
  condition (JS syntax) is met.
* custom_color (optional): it allows to set custom color for fsm.stages
  example custom_color = "true". And there is minor condition to follow to
  implement this as. Define any one stage color condition like
  colors="#ffffff:stage_id=='New';"
