Some field service operations may need to track the size of a field
service location and its orders.

Examples of sizes might be:
- Area measure of a location
- Count of service or maintenance items at a location

Once established, sizes can be useful for route capacity planning,
time estimation for orders, or for planning stock and inventory moves.

This module allows you to establish sizes for your field service orders.
Multiple sizes can be configured and established for a location. Order
size will be updated based on its location and order type.
