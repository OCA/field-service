Some field service operations may need to track the size of a field
service location and its orders.

Examples of sizes might be:
- Area measure of a location
- Count of service or maintenance items at a location

Once established, sizes can be useful for route capacity planning,
time estimation for orders, or for planning stock and inventory moves.

This module allows you to establish sizes for your field service orders.
Multiple sizes can be configured and established for a location. Order
size will be updated based on its location and order type.

Configuration
=============

To configure field service sizes, go to Configuration > Sizes.

Set the size name, type of orders to which the size will apply,
and unit of measure for the size. If this size is the default
size to be used for orders of the designated type, select the
option for 'Is Order Size'.

Usage
=====

## Enter sizes for field service locations.
Go to Master Data > Locations

#. Select or create a location.
#. Go to the Sizes tab.
#. Select a Size. Enter the value for the size.

## Use Order Sizes

#. Select or create a field service order.
#. Set a location on the order.
#. Set a type on the order.
#. The size value will update to the location's size
   value of the order type's default size.
