Installation
============

To install Field Service and have the mapping features, you need to install GeoEngine.

Please refer to the installation instructions available at:
https://github.com/OCA/geospatial/tree/11.0/base_geoengine

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to Field Service > Master Data > Locations
* Create or select a location and set the inventory location
* Go to Inventory > Configuration > Routes
* Select the routes that you want to use from a FSM order
* Check the box 'FSM Order Line' for outbound transfer
* Check the box 'FSM Return Line' for inbound transfer

The route 'Receipt in 1 step' has no procurement rule so if you want items to be
returned from the service location to your warehouse, you need to create a new
procurement rule for that route:

* Name: YourCompany: Return
* Action: Move From Another Location
* Procurement Location:	WH/Stock
* Served Warehouse:	YourCompany
* Source Location: Partner Locations/Customers
* Move Supply Method: Take From Stock
* Operation Type: YourCompany: Receipts

If you are in a multi-warehouse situation:

* Go to Field Service > Configuration > Territories
* Create or select a territory
* Set the warehouse that will serve this territory

Products can be automatically converted into FSM Equipments.
This is only available only for products tracked by serial number.
This needs to be enabled both on Operation Types and Products.
For example, we may want to create the FSM Equipment on Delivery,
or on Receipts.

To enable on Products:

* Go to Inventory > Master Data > Products
* Open the Product form, Inventory tab
* On the "Traceability" section, make sure
  "Tracking" is set to "By Unique Serial Number"
* Enable the "Creates FSM Equipment" checkbox

To enable on Operation Types:

* Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operation Types
* Select the intended Operation Type ("Receipts" for example)
* On the "Traceability" section, enable the
  "Create FSM Equipment" checkbox

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Create a new service order
* Under the Inventory tab, select the warehouse and add products with quantity
* Confirm the order to create the delivery orders
* Validate the transfers in the Inventory app. Quantities delivered on FSM
  Order Line will be updated.
