Installation
============

To install Field Service and have the mapping features, you need to install GeoEngine.

Please refer to the installation instructions available at:
https://github.com/OCA/geospatial/tree/12.0/base_geoengine

Configuration
=============

Products must be configured properly in order to create field service
orders upon sale order confirmation.

The field service tracking of a product defines how it generates a field service
order if the product is sold via sale order.

To configure a product that generates a unique field service order on each
sale order line:

* Go to Sales > Catalog > Products
* Create or select a product
* Set the Field Service Tracking to 'One FSM Order per Sale Order Line'
* Select the FSM Order Template that will be used for creating FSM Orders when
  a Sale Order is confirmed with this product

To configure a product that generates a unique field service order for
an individual sale order:

* Go to Sales > Catalog > Products
* Create or select a product
* Set the Field Service Tracking to 'One FSM Order per Sale Order'
* Select the FSM Order Template that will be used for creating FSM Orders when
  a Sale Order is confirmed with this product

To setup a sales territory:

* Go to Field Service > Master Data > Locations
* Create or select a location
* Go to the Sales tab and select the sales territory

Usage
=====

* Go to Sales
* Create a new Quotation/Sale Order
* Set the FSM Location to be used
* On a Sale Order Line, select a product configured for field service orders
* Confirm the Sale Order
* Field Service orders linked to SO lines are created
* When a Field Service order is completed, the quantity delivered for its
   linked sale order line will be updated to the quantity ordered, indicating
   this line is ready for invoicing.
