Odoo Field Service App allows to assign any FS worker to any FS order.
For some organizations, they cannot assign any FS worker to any order.
They needs to manage the skills of the FS workers and reduce the list of
potential FS workers on an order to avoid wrong assignment and mis-configuration.
The skills of the selectable FS workers on a service order needs to match the
required skills to perform the order.

This modules allows you to set skills on categories to automatically set those
skills on the order. It also allows you to set the skills to the field service
worker with their level. On the order, the list of field service workers is
filtered with the skills and the location so you can only assign the right
worker to the order.
