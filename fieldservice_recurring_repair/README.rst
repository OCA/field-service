This module allows you to manage your recurring field service work
orders linked to repairs.

As repairs are often recurring and ``fieldservice_repair`` accept only
one equipment, this module allows you to create a recurring work order
for several equipments. This way, you can create a recurring order for a
group of equipments and the ``fsm.order`` will be created for each
equipment.
