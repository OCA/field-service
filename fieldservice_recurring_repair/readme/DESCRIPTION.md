This module allows you to manage your recurring field service work
orders linked to repairs.

As repairs are often recurring and `fieldservice_repair` accept only one
equipment, this module allows you to create a recurring work order for several
equipments. This way, you can create a recurring order for a group of equipments
and the `fsm.order` will be created for each equipment.
