As the stage of a field service document progresses, it may be important for
specific fields of the document be completed.

For example, when a field service order enters the 'Complete' stage, the
fields for 'Actual End Date' and/or 'Resolution Notes' should be set.

This module allows you to raise a Validation Error if the designated fields
are not set when moving to a new stage. Since stages can be used for field
service orders, workers, locations, or equipments, this logic is available
to be applied to each document type.
