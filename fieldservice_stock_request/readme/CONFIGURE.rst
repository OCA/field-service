To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to Inventory > Configuration > Routes
* Select the routes that you want to use from a FSM order
* Check the box 'FSM Order Line' for outbound transfer
* Check the box 'FSM Return Line' for inbound transfer

The route 'Receipt in 1 step' has no procurement rule so if you want items to be
returned from the service location to your warehouse, you need to create a new
procurement rule for that route:

* Name: YourCompany: Return
* Action: Move From Another Location
* Procurement Location:	WH/Stock
* Served Warehouse:	YourCompany
* Source Location: Partner Locations/Customers
* Move Supply Method: Take From Stock
* Operation Type: YourCompany: Receipts
