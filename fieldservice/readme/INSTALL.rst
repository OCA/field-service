As of version 12, you can install Field Service alone without mapping features.

To install Field Service and have the mapping features, you need to install GeoEngine.
GeoEngine requires you to have `PostGIS <http://postgis.net/>`_ installed and also
install two additional python libs:

* `Shapely <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`_
* `geojson <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson>`_

Please refer to the installation instructions available at:
