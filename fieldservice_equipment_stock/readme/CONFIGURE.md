Products can be automatically converted into FSM Equipments. This is
only available only for products tracked by serial number. This needs to
be enabled both on Operation Types and Products. For example, we may
want to create the FSM Equipment on Delivery, or on Receipts.

To enable on Products:

- Go to Inventory \> Master Data \> Products
- Open the Product form, Inventory tab
- On the "Traceability" section, make sure "Tracking" is set to "By
  Unique Serial Number"
- Enable the "Creates FSM Equipment" checkbox

To enable on Operation Types:

- Go to Inventory \> Configuration \> Operation Types
- Select the intended Operation Type ("Receipts" for example)
- On the "Traceability" section, enable the "Create FSM Equipment"
  checkbox
