To use this module you must first generate some stock moves that
that will be transferred using a stock operation type which supports
FSM vehicle loading.

In order to confirm the transfer, a FSM Vehicle must be set. The FSM
Vehicle can be set manually on the transfer in the Additional Info tab
or it will be automatically set if the transfer has a linked FSM Order
and a vehicle is assigned to that order.

When the FSM Vehicle is updated on a transfer, the destination locations
are updated to reflect the vehicle storage location.
