If inventory items were delivered to a customer location, the delivery will generate an accounting entry in the stock output account. The balance of that account will keep increasing as those inventory items will not get invoiced.

This module allows you to automatically adds inventory items delivered as part of the field service order to a customer invoice to account for their value as a cost of goods (or service) sold.
