If inventory items were delivered to a customer location, the delivery will generate an accounting entry in the stock output account. The balance of that account will keep increasing as those inventory items will not get invoiced.

This module allows you to automatically adds inventory items delivered as part of the field service order to a customer invoice to account for their value as a cost of goods (or service) sold.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to Field Service
* Create an order for a customer location (type of the inventory location must be 'Customer')
* Add inventory items and process them. Their delivery will generate an accounting entry.
* Complete the field service order
* Add some contractor costs or timesheet entries depending on the worker (vendor or employee)
* In the accounting tab, click on "Create invoice". The delivered inventory items will be added to the customer invoice with a 0$ price unit and they will not show up in the PDF report of the invoice.

    * Go to Invoicing > Customers > Invoices
    * Validate the invoice.
    * Check the accounting entry to make sure the value of the inventory items is accounted as a cost of goods/services sold.

* Repeat the process but in the accounting tab, click on "No invoice"

    * Go to Invoicing > Customers > Invoices
    * Open the invoice related to the field service order
    * Check that the invoice has a 0$ total and is paid
    * Check the accounting entry to make sure the value of the inventory items is accounted as a cost of goods/services sold.
