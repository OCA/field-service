To use the module:

On a field service order, open the "Accounting" tab. 

Choose whether to invoice the location or contact by setting
the Bill To option.

Select a cost method of Timesheets or Fixed.

If cost is to be determined by timesheet and depending on whether
the logged in user or an employee or not, they will see either
a place to enter timesheet records or contractor costs.

The total cost of the order is calculated based on the entries in
the employee timesheet entries and contractor costs.

When an order is completed, a customer invoice will be generated for
the employee time and the contractor costs. A vendor bill will be
created for the contractor costs.

If cost is determined by a fixed rate, the user will be able to set
a fixed price and product. The invoice created when the order is completed
will use these values.
