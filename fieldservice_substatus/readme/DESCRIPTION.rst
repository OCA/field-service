Odoo and the Field Service App do not provide a way to track what is required
and/or missing at the different stages of the FSM order process. Some
organizations needs a way to track documentation, materials, signature
and various activities.

This module allows you to have a list of sub-statuses and set them as default 
or potential sub-statuses on each FSM stage. The stage configuration will drive:

* the sub-status set when entering a stage
* the list of potential sub-statuses available depending on the stage
