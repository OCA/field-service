A Work Order is a task or job for a Customer that can be scheduled and assigned to someone.
Work Order assignments can be simple, but even complicated assignments can be managed
simply with the use of Forms and Packages.

Work Order Components
---------------------
- work order id and name
- Customer
- description and instructions
- assigned agent
- start and end
- work items or jobs
- Forms

Forms are not required, but one or more Forms can be used to organize
or document activities with customized and re-usable checklists.
Forms can contain pages that can be used to give “logic” to which
items in a Form will be presented.
